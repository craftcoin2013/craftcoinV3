SPECIAL THANKS TO ORIGINAL CRAFTCOIN DEVELOPERS AND DEVELOPERS OF GIFcoin/CraftCoin

## What's New in V3.0.0?
This release is an update aimed at modernizing the Craftcoin blockchain with AuxPow support for merged mining.

## Features
- **AuxPow Support**: Enables merged mining with other compatible blockchains.
- **Updated Dependencies**: Incorporates updates to critical libraries for improved performance and compatibility.
- **Optimized Performance**: Various improvements for better stability and efficiency.

## Technical Parameters
The following parameters are preserved from the original CraftCoin repository (circa 2013) to maintain compatibility with the original blockchain:

### New Parameters (Starting Block 32000)
*From original 2013 GitHub repository*
- 1 Minute blocktime target (Faster transactions!)
- 2 Coins per block (Adjusted for faster blocks, same targeted payout per hour as before)
- 100,000,000 Total Coins (unchanged)
- Difficulty Adjustment Every 60 Blocks (1 hour) sampling last 240 blocks (4 hours)
- Reduced max diff adjustment to 25% (from 100% previously)

These changes result in a more stable, faster blockchain.

### Old Parameters (Until Block 32000)
*From original 2013 GitHub repository*
- 10 Coins Per Block
- 5 Minutes Between Blocks
- 100,000,000 Total Coins
- Difficulty Adjustment Every 12 Blocks

## Implementation

A comprehensive package containing all necessary software and plugins to implement CRC on Minecraft servers will be available soon. Please check back for updates.

## Development process

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt) or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new official, stable release versions of CraftCoin.

Feature branches are created when there are major new features being worked on by several people.

From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure. The pull will be closed 15 days after the warning if action is not taken by the author. Pull requests closed in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.

Issues with no commits will be given a similar warning, and closed after 15 days from their last activity. Issues closed in this manner will be labeled 'stale'.
